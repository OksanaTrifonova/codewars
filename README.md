Codewars Tasks

LEVEL 6. Task #1: Longest Palindrome  - https://www.codewars.com/kata/54bb6f887e5a80180900046b/train/java

Description. Find the length of the longest substring in the given string s that is the same in reverse. As an example, if the input was “I like racecars that go fast”, the substring (racecar) length would be 7. If the length of the input string is 0, the return value must be 0.

Task #2: Find The Parity Outlier  - https://www.codewars.com/kata/5526fc09a1bbd946250002dc/train/java

Description. You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.
Task #3: Perimeter of Fibonacci Rectangle - https://www.codewars.com/kata/59c35ba16bddd219ee000082/train/java

Description. The drawing shows 6 squares the sides of which have a length of 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8. The perimeter of the overall rectangle is 42. 
Give the perimeter of a rectangle when there are n + 1 squares disposed.
The function perimeter has the parameter n where n + 1 is the number of squares (they are numbered from 0 to n), and returns the perimeter of the overall rectangle (not of its component squares).
