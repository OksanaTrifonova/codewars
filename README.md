Description.
Find the length of the longest substring in the given string s that is the same in reverse.
As an example, if the input was “I like racecars that go fast”, the substring (racecar) length would be 7.
If the length of the input string is 0, the return value must be 0.

Description.
You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.
